# Application installation

Kubernetes applications can be deployed with kubectl or helm. However, you need some experience for this. That's why I created so-called kuba app packages for a few applications. This means that the applications can be installed just as easily as kuba itself.

## Kuba app packages

* wordpress
* minio (s3 storage)
* minecraft (java)
* minecraft (bedrock)
* keycloak
* vault
* argocd
* gitea
* matrix

## Helm
